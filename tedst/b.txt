A benefit of hiring me over a company would be the access to a firsthand look at 
development, this will not only increase the final productâ€™s quality, but it will 
minimize costs, as well as developing time. By having me working at the office a couple of 
times a week, mistakes will be corrected sooner and the deliverable will function as expected.
